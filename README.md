## Instructions

The [starter project](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
